Udemy Machine learning course

https://www.udemy.com/machinelearning/ 

Took this course on top of my studies as they did not offer any modules in Machine learning in 3rd year. 
I found the course very challenging but I feel it has given me a firm foundation in Machine learning.This course was taught both Python and R.
I will be taking another course in deep learning to again improve my understanding and knowledge.
